# On Becoming a technical tester

As a tester, you span two worlds -- the world of business requirements and the world of software engineering. 

By improving your technical skills you will be able to:

* Add value by finding bugs that are not easily found by just testing via the user interface.
* Provide developers with additional information that will help them debug faster
* Enjoy your work more due to increased understanding of all layers of the system
* Build rapport with developers by sharing a common understanding and technical language
